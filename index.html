                        Clarity is essential when using the term ‘mental health’.According to the dictionary,mental
                        health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It includes the way you
                        think, act, feel and relate to others. Once you are satisfied with what you have, you will
                        achieve inner calm or composure. Being satisfied doesn't imply that one should quit attempting
                        to accomplish something better. It intends to attempt to turn out to be better with whatever
                        assets or resourses you have and this is the way one can accomplish true serenity and can be
                        intellectually sound. Mental well-being means neither being too much happy when one get
                        everything nor being too much depressed when you loose something.</p>
                    <h4>IMPORTANCE OF MENTAL HEALTH</h4>
                    <p><img src="images/para1.jpg" alt="" height="460" width="240">Mental fitness is a nation of
                        thoughts which could be very essential to perform different day
                        after day activities. State of mind is every important when you want to achieve something.
                        Stability can help them get better, but instability can lead to depression and anxiety. If you
                        are not mentally healthy then you find it diffcult to focus of good things.
                        Mental health is sort of a person’s diet. most are on a diet. Your diet is what you eat day in
                        and day out. you can not operate without mental state. If your mental health is of course
                        “healthy”, it'll show within the thoughts, emotions, and actions you participate in. If your
                        mental health is “unhealthy”, life becomes tough for you and people around you. But, rather like
                        you have got to eat, you have a mental health that you simply do or don’t beware of.
                        Person's thoughts can have major effects on their actions. A depressed person can feel alone in
                        this world even when they’re surrounded by others. That person’s family may leave him/her to
                        fend for themselves in the world during life’s hardships and that can make the person feel alone
                        because of them carrying that burden. That person may feel fed up with facing and handeling
                        their issues alone and kill themselves. Depending on how bad a person’s circumstances are, the
                        type of person it is, if they’re not strong enough mentally, emotionally or lack information on
                        coping skills, they can commit suicide or even kill another person. The fact that people can't
                        see or feel the other person’s pain. They don’t take it very seriously what goes on in the mind
                        effects andhow the person will act out.
                        It's important to learn about mental health for the same reason it's important to learn about
                        physical health. Your brain is not a seperate entity that lives in an alternate universe. It is
                        an organ and it's part of you. Sometimes, just as a heart might require treatment, so might the
                        brain. It's important not only for you to have a basic knowledge for yourself, but to help keep
                        you and others from passing rash judgement on those affected.</p>

                    <h3>ANXIETY DISORDERS</h3>
                    <p>

                        Anxiety is a normal emotion. It’s your brain’s way of reacting to stress and alerting you of
                        potential danger ahead.

                        Everyone feels anxious now and then. For example, you may worry when faced with a problem at
                        work, before taking a test, or before making an important decision.

                        Occasional anxiety is OK. But anxiety disorders are different. They’re a group of mental
                        illnesses that cause constant and overwhelming anxiety and fear. The excessive anxiety can make
                        you avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that might trigger or
                        worsen your symptoms.

                        With treatment, many people with anxiety disorders can manage their feelings.
                        The main symptom of anxiety disorders is excessive fear or worry. Anxiety disorders can also
                        make it hard to breathe, sleep, stay still, and concentrate. Your specific symptoms depend on
                        the type of anxiety disorder you have. <img src="images/anxiety-disorder.jpg" alt=""

                    <h3>MOOD DISORDERS</h3>
                    <p>
                        A mood disorder is a mental health problem that primarily affects a person’s emotional state. It
                        is a disorder in which a person experiences long periods of extreme happiness, extreme sadness,
                        or both.

                        It is normal for someone’s mood to change, depending on the situation. However, to be diagnosed
                        with a mood disorder, symptoms must be present for several weeks or longer. Mood disorders can
                        cause changes in your behavior and can affect your ability to deal with routine activities, such
                        as work or school.Two of the most common mood disorders are depression and bipolar disorder.Mood
                        disorders such as depression and bipolar disorder may recur or be ongoing and therefore may
                        require long-term or lifetime treatment. It is important to take your medications as
                        prescribed.<br>Seek help immediately if you feel suicidal or have thoughts of harming yourself
                        or others.<img src="images/mood-disorder.jpg" alt="" height="200" width="200"></p>
                    <h3>SCHIZOPHRENIA</h3>
                    <p>
                        Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally.
                        Schizophrenia may result in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely
                        disordered thinking and behavior that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.

                        People with schizophrenia require lifelong treatment. Early treatment may help get symptoms
                        under control before serious complications develop and may help improve the long-term outlook.
                        Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior and emotions.
                        Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized
                        speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function.Suicidal thoughts and behavior are common
                        among people with schizophrenia. <br>If you have a loved one who is in danger of attempting
                        suicide
                        or has made a suicide attempt, make sure someone stays with that person.

                    <h3>DEMENTIA</h3>
                    <p style="margin-right: 230px;">
                        Dementia is a collective term used to describe various symptoms of cognitive decline, such as
                        forgetfulness. It is a symptom of several underlying diseases and brain disorders.

                        Dementia is not a single disease in itself, but a general term to describe symptoms of
                        impairment in memory, communication, and thinking.

                        While the likelihood of having dementia increases with age, it is not a normal part of
                        aging.A person with dementia may show any of the symptoms listed below, mostly due to memory
                        loss.

                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li><b>Recent memory loss – </b>a sign of this might be asking the same question repeatedly.<img
                                src="images/types-of-dementia-1.jpg" alt="" height="160" width="250"></li>
                        <li><b>Difficulty completing familiar tasks – </b>for example, making a drink or cooking a meal.
                        </li>
                        <li> <b>Problems communicating –</b> difficulty with language; forgetting simple words or using
                            the wrong ones.</li>
                        <li><b>Disorientation –</b> getting lost on a previously familiar street, for example.</li>
                        <li><b> Problems with abstract thinking –</b> for instance, dealing with money.</li>
                        <li><b>Misplacing things – </b>forgetting the location of everyday items such as keys, or
                            wallets, for example.</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <h3>EATING DISORDERS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Eating disorders are real, complex medical and psychiatric illnesses that can have serious
                        consequences for health, productivity and relationships.

                        Eating disorders, including anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder and OSFED
                        (other specified feeding or eating disorder), are bio-psycho-social diseases-- not fads, phases
                        or lifestyle choices.

                        People struggling with an eating disorder often become obsessed with food, body image and/or
                        weight. These disorders can be life-threatening if not recognized and treated appropriate.Eating
                        disorders are treatable, and earlier diagnosis and intervention often leads to better outcomes.
                        The most effective and long-lasting treatment for an eating disorder is some form of
                        psychotherapy or counseling, coupled with careful attention to medical and nutritional needs.
                        Ideally, whatever treatment is offered should be tailored to the individual; this will vary
                        according to both the severity of the disorder and the patient's individual problems, needs and
                        strengths.

                        Treatment must address the eating disorder symptoms and medical consequences, as well as
                        psychological, biological, interpersonal and cultural forces that contribute to or maintain the
                        eating disorder. <img src="images/eating-disorders.jpg" alt="" height="270" width="250"></p>
                    <h3>PSYCHOTIC DISORDERS</h3>
                    <p>
                        Psychotic disorders are a group of serious illnesses that affect the mind. They make it hard for
                        someone to think clearly, make good judgments, respond emotionally, communicate effectively,
                        understand reality, and behave appropriately.

                        When symptoms are severe, people with psychotic disorders have trouble staying in touch with
                        reality and often are unable to handle daily life. But even severe psychotic disorders usually
                        can be treated.<br>Doctors don't know the exact cause of psychotic disorders. Researchers
                        believe that many things play a role. Some psychotic disorders tend to run in families, which
                        means that the disorder may be partly inherited. Other things may also influence their
                        development, including stress, drug abuse, and major life changes.<img

                    <p>When we fall or get injured, it’s only natural to immediately ask for help because it hurts and
                        we want to feel better. However, if some is struggling with internal pain, has loneliness,
                        depression, anxiety, isolation, or hopelessness, or someone perceives others are judging them
                        due to their mental illness, many people hesitate to ask for help in the same way they would for
                        a physical injury.

                        Unfortunately, this is the case for many who suffer from a mental illness, such as anxiety,
                        PTSD, depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder or schizophrenia. There are
                        many reasons people keep their feelings quiet and don’t ask for help. Some examples are when
                        people worry about what others may think of them or worry, they will be judged by their mental
                        illness, or struggle with unhelpful thoughts such as “asking for help is a weakness.” Perhaps
                        people believe seeking help shows there is something wrong with them. Messages people receive
                        from others, the media, their culture, society, and from themselves often cause much worry and
                        anxiety and can hinder recovery and seeking help. </p>

                        It moves you from the sympathetic nervous system to the parasympathetic nervous system, or from
                        flight-or-flight to rest-and-digest. You typically have less anxiety and enter a more relaxed
                        state. As soon as you start breathing deeply, you slow down out of fight-or-flight and calm your
                        nervous system.

                        It helps you build your sense of self. Through yoga, you get to know yourself and cultivate a

                        and eat healthier, because your unconscious mind tells you, “I’m worthy of this me time, this
                        effort.” At the end of the day, everything comes down to your relationship with yourself. When
                        you get more confident and become more rooted in your sense of self and your center, you develop
                        a healthy, balanced ego, where you have nothing to prove and nothing to hide. You become
                        courageous, with high willpower. You’re not afraid of difficult conversations—you know you’re
                        still going to be OK at the end of the day.<br>


                        It helps you become aware of your “shadow” qualities. The yoking of solar and lunar (light
                        and dark) in yoga makes us recognize qualities in ourselves that we were not aware of, helping
                        us be more mindful. A lot of my work centers on the shadow concept from Carl Jung. How do we
                        look at those places in our bodies where we hold tension, tightness, knots of energy? That’s
                        typically where we are holding our psychological or emotional energy. We work from the outside
                        in, so asana is so important. A backbend will open your heart and release the stiffness between
                        the shoulder blades—at some point, you will have some sort of emotional release, which you may
                        or may not be conscious of. It’s about doing the inner work to shift or change and be open to
                        doing your best with your weaknesses and faults.</p>
                    <h3>MEDITATION</h3>
                    <img src="images/meditation.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="800">
                    <p>
                        Since time immemorial, meditation has been used to attain enlightenment. Wise ones have touted
                        it as a means to get rid of misery. Experiences and modern research show that meditation is
                        helpful for life goals as regular and diverse as overcoming a traumatic heartbreak to increasing
                        daily productivity. Modern day meditators call it the food for the soul and suggest that the
                        practice can unlock doors to a better life.<br>Research has shown benefits of meditation towards
                        mental health. It helps relieve stress, reduce anxiety, increase kindness, improve
                        self-awareness and self-esteem.If stress has you anxious, tense and worried, consider trying
                        meditation. Spending even a few minutes in meditation can restore your calm and inner peace.<br>

                        Anyone can practice meditation. It's simple and inexpensive, and it doesn't require any special
                        equipment.

                        And you can practice meditation wherever you are — whether you're out for a walk, riding the
                        bus, waiting at the doctor's office or even in the middle of a difficult business meeting. </p>
                    <h3>MEDICATION</h3>
                    <img src="images/medication.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="800">
                    <p>
                        There are several different types of drugs available to treat mental illnesses. Some of the most
                        commonly used are antidepressants, anti-anxiety, antipsychotic, mood stabilizing, and stimulant
                        medications.<br>When treating depression, several drug options are available.Your healthcare
                        provider can determine which medication is right for you. Remember that medications usually take
                        4 to 6 weeks to become fully effective. And if one drug does not work, there are many others to
                        try.In some cases, a combination of antidepressants sometimes called augmentation, may be
                        necessary. Sometimes an antidepressant combined with a different type of drug, such as a mood
                        stabilizer (like Lithium), a second antidepressant, or atypical anti-psychotic drug, is the most
                        effective treatment.

                        Side effects vary, depending on what type of drug you are taking, and may improve once your body
                        adjusts to the medication.
                    </p>
                    <h3>EDUCATE YOUSELF AND OTHERS</h3>
                    <img src="images/educate.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="800">
                    <p>
                        Knowledge is power. Educate yourself (from reputable sources) about mental illness, symptoms and
                        treatments. Being informed is the first step in getting the proper treatment one needs for
                        emotional wellness.

                        In addition, educate others that mental illness is a physical disorder that can be treated just
                        as one would treat any other medical issue. Arm them with factual information to replace much of
                        the rumors or inaccuracies surrounding mental illness.

                        You (or your loved ones) can also talk openly about the illness and daily struggles with safe
                        and supportive people. Telling supportive persons about one’s recovery process will help people
                        to understand the challenges others faces. When people truly understand what mental illness is,
                        they are more likely to move past their negative views. Remember to avoid expecting people to
                        understand right away. Stigma takes time to overcome. Be gentle with yourself and others in this
                        process. Family therapy may also be helpful and be a neutral place to discuss barriers and
                        obstacles.


                    </p>
                    <h3>JOIN A SUPPORT GROUP</h3>
                    <img src="images/Support.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="800">
                    <p>
                        Don’t isolate. If people don’t tell anyone about their struggles with mental illness, no one can
                        help them. There are many local and national support groups that offer programs and resources.
                        In addition, these groups are working hard to educate people with mental illnesses, their
                        families, their supportive persons and their communities to help reduce stigma and move toward
                        empowerment and recovery.
                        The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (if it
                        applies), are great places to start, and both are reputable resources. Check your county to see
                        what programing is offered. Often there are online groups and online resources for those
                        diagnosed with mental illnesses, along with resources and groups for their supportive persons.
                    </p>
                    <h3>SPEAK-UP AGAINST STIGMA</h3>
                    <img src="images/speak.jpg" alt="" height="250" width="800">
                    <p>
                        Whether it’s with a group of friends or in front of a large audience, express your opinions in
                        an assertive and confident manner. Educate others respectfully about mental illness, to help
                        promote change. Remind people that they wouldn’t make fun of someone suffering from heart
                        disease, diabetes or cancer. Making fun of someone with mental illness is harmful, and only
                        increases stigma, and promotes discrimination. Speaking up will not only educate the public and
                        help reduce stigma, but it could also give courage to others facing a similar challenge, and
                        help them to seek help. Remember self-care during this process is vital. You are not alone; you
                        do not have to fight every battle. Reach out for help, and remember: self-compassion and
                        self-care is a gift we all need to open daily.</p>

                    <h3>BENEFITS OF MENTAL HEALTH BLOGGING</h3>
                    <p>Blogging came into existence in the mid-90’s and is now part of our mainstream culture. However,
                        long before the advent of the internet, writing was advocated by psychologists as a constructive
                        way to process thoughts and emotions which arose from traumatic experiences.Purposeful writing
                        has psychological benefits such as lowering anxiety, reducing ruminative thoughts and depressive
                        symptoms. Writing offers a unique sense of purpose and achievement, and the opportunity to
                        develop important and rewarding writing skills.<br>

                        Writing empowers, and by reframing your relationship with your mental health it can help you
                        understand your problems in a more productive way. This can help you think differently and make
                        meaningful changes in your life. Writing, like therapy, makes use of a ‘third space’ in which
                        people can safely share and learn about themselves.</p>
