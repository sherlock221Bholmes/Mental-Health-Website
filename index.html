                    <p>A mental illness is often something that should be brought to the attention of a psychiatrist.
                        But maintaining mental peace is highly important in order to “keep it under control". So maybe
                        this will help to control a mental illness.</p>
                    <p>There might not be a "cure" for mental illness, but the methods below can help alleviate the
                        condition and possibly help you recover, at least temporarily, to the point where you feel
                        "normal" again.</p>
                    <ul class="listarrow">
                        <li>
                            <h4 style="color:darkorange; font-weight: bolder;">Yoga and meditation -</h4> Yoga and
                            meditation are must.
                            Meditating for an hour everyday helps a lot. You can start with small amount of time and
                            gradually increase it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4 style="color:darkorange; font-weight: bolder;">Medication- </h4>
                            </h4Medication> Let go of your skepticism (if you have any) and try medication. If it
                            doesn't
                            feel right, let your doctor know right away and try something else. Just because one
                            medication doesn't work does not mean that no medication will work.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4 style="color:darkorange; font-weight: bolder;">Therapy Support Groups - </h4>Again, try
                            it. And if you don't like your therapist, try
                            another. If you don't like the type of therapy, try a different one (talk, CBT, DBT,
                            analysis, group). I highly recommend trying group therapy. You will benefit from both
                            feeling less alone and from the experience of others who have tried other things.
                        </li>

                            <h4 style="color:darkorange; font-weight: bolder;">Stay in touch with people -</h4> When you
                            feel that the illness is at peaks make sure to
                            stay in
                            touch with people and have a reality check. As soon as you experience something wrong (eg:
                            hallucinations) contantly remind yourself of where you are and how safe you are.
                        </li>

                            in good health or the idea of the gym completely
                            overwhelms you, start by going for short walks. Make sure you move frequently throughout the
                            day, even if it's just to walk to the kitchen (just make sure you get off the couch or out
                            of bed).

                <p style="font-size: large;font-weight: bolder;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);">Mental health blogs capitalise on
                    the relatable nature of issues. We learn by social modelling, and
                    people love to read about what other people experience, see how they manage, how they progress and
                    overcome challenges. Blogging about mental health issues, helps people feel connected, empowered and
                    energised and can help them feel less stuck and alone with their problems and distress.
                    We all have mental health, and blogs importantly, effectively and creatively raise mental health
                    awareness. Knowledge and understanding are part of the antidote to the stigma and negative
                    psychological and social effects associated with mental health.

                    Two types of experts exist: experts by training and experts by experience. Mental health blogs
                    embrace the value of the expert by experience. Blogs are a form of self-expression, education, and
                    can be inspiring, empowering and therapeutic.
                    Scientific research demonstrates that writing can have a positive physical impact too. This includes
                    enhanced immune function, lower blood pressure, decreased heart rate, a reduction in asthma and
                    arthritis symptoms, and fewer sleep disturbances.

                    You should invest in yourself and society differently. When blogging about mental health, there are
                    no limits to what people may be interested in. There will always be someone interested in reading
                    what you have to say. Take a positive risk, a deep breath, and remember that every story starts with
                    the first word.
